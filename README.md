# Mapping world precipitations

In this brief project, geopandas is used for plotting monthly mean temperatures, from 1990 to 2021, across the globe

This involves the following:
- Processing gridded N-dimensional (latitude x longitude x time) datafiles in NetCDF format using **dask**
- Data wrangling
- geopandas plotting

The plot showcases regions with higher and lower average yearly precipitations
